Events page: "Expo" had a different image than "Trunk Show". I can get the expo image to you if you need it again.
Change "newsletter" to Email Brides.
The newsletter link in the admin section: that's more of an email thing. they want to email brides to tell them when their appointment has been scheduled. They just want a graphic to it --so that's why we consider it a newsletter. {i guess they would refer to it more as an 'email to brides'}
But i'll let them know that it's titled "newsletter". They know this part will take more time after the site is done.
