I
10:50pmJim

nominative case pronoun

good job
10:52pmJim

ok.... pop quiz time:

when someone tells you something's impossible you:

A. agree, and sympathize

B. Try to concoct a way to succeed.

C. Blindly say "oh hell no, I can make it happen I don't care WHAT it is!!!"
10:53pmHeather-Sarah

um, i need a real example
10:53pmJim

well that would kinda violate C wouldn't it?

i mean

think about it

now you've gotten me thinking

what has someone told you is impossible?
10:55pmHeather-Sarah

dunno

cant think of anything
10:55pmJim

surely at some point in your life, someone has told you something is impossible

or was impossible

perhaps you conquered it

who knows

the point is

what's your initial reaction
10:56pmHeather-Sarah

mmmmmm or maybe i know when something really is impossible and therefore dont attempt to do it
10:56pmJim

really?

wow

what would you consider REALLY impossible?
10:56pmHeather-Sarah

that i would enjoy being in teh army

thats impossible
10:56pmJim

hmmmmm

good point i suppose
10:57pmHeather-Sarah

but like winning the lottery

its possible

getiting a golden ticket to michale jacks memorial... its possible
10:57pmJim

well i'm thinking more along the lines of someone saying you "can't" yet you would say "oh yes I can"

so
10:57pmHeather-Sarah

being cast in a commerical.... its possssible
10:57pmJim

JOINING the army

might count

some might tell you
10:57pmHeather-Sarah

ya but i dont want to
10:58pmJim

well it's not about "want to"

it's about could you
10:58pmHeather-Sarah

so i wouldnt car eif someone toldme tht was impossible
10:58pmJim

well that just offers you full right of refusal

and you could cheat

and say that for anything

you didn't want to do

someone dares you to jump out of a plane
10:58pmHeather-Sarah

but anything i want to do is possible

id go skydiving
10:59pmJim

yeah and how many things that you don't want to do are possible for you?

POSSIBLE

not joyous "oh yes, I can't wait to succeed in that" things

but

"fine, i'll do it, but only to prove you wrong" type things
11:00pmHeather-Sarah

what??
11:01pmJim

did that not make sense?

what have you been told is impossible?
11:02pmHeather-Sarah

nothing

oooh wait yes!
11:02pmJim

good

let's hear it
11:02pmHeather-Sarah

that people can't be born biologically, genetically gay.
11:03pmJim

ok.... now even though i'm not sure that applies to you

that might just count
11:03pmHeather-Sarah

ha. im not gay

but i think people can be born gay. and for others its a choice because of things that happened when they were young.
11:03pmJim

indeed
11:04pmHeather-Sarah

i can tell by looking at aphoto if someone is gay or not

biologically
11:04pmJim

really?
11:04pmHeather-Sarah

yes
11:04pmJim

am i gay?
11:04pmHeather-Sarah

and of course i was raised like every other christian to know that it wa sa sin and a choice and can be cured!!!.... untl i relaized my ability to identify

only u know that for sure kim

jim

ha!
11:04pmJim

lol

nice
11:05pmHeather-Sarah

i dont tellllll people they are gay
11:05pmJim

I don't feel gay... but my sister's friend swore i was

or am

or whatever

i've never really considered it

but it would be a nice excuse to dress better

that's for sure
11:05pmHeather-Sarah

but i know a number of christian boys ... who are gay... but married anyway... cause it would cure them... if they even admitted to themselves there was an issue there...
11:05pmJim

oh wow

i don't think i'd do that

it would be a big lie
11:06pmHeather-Sarah

iiiii know
11:06pmJim

one you'd have to wake up with every day
11:06pmHeather-Sarah

but theyre raised to think its a sin and something they can control

so better get merried cause itll cure it

!!

right??
11:06pmJim

there are lots of things that are "wrong"
11:06pmHeather-Sarah

yep
11:06pmJim

lying
11:06pmHeather-Sarah

tim haggart

11:06pmHeather-Sarah

11:07pmJim

11:07pmHeather-Sarah

i saw his image on teh news with the words "pastor church scanal" under his photo... my tv was muted.... i looked at him and was like, well duh, hes gay..... annnnnnd ya, busted for sex with a man
11:07pmJim

yep

had to get blasted out of his mind first but yep

that was his scene
11:09pmHeather-Sarah

well imagine you were told ur whole life that its a SIN to find angela attractive and to want to be with her and to make out and whatever... haha think of how guilty ud be about those feelings?? ud want to numb that down too
11:09pmJim

well... you DO have to realize that I was 21 and she was 17... and mormon... so

there was a whole lot of

"you should NOT be attracted to her!!"

type stuff going on

from my parents

hers

etc
11:10pmHeather-Sarah

ya but ur relgions was saying it was a sing

sin

that something as wrong with you for liking her

that god wouldnt accept u because u liked her
11:10pmJim

well not exactly

more like
11:10pmHeather-Sarah

not teh same
11:10pmJim

wow you perv.... why would you be interested in someone that yong

young
11:10pmHeather-Sarah

not the same
11:11pmJim

no

not really
11:11pmHeather-Sarah

ya kinda gross actually

but not the same
11:11pmJim

oh shut up
11:11pmHeather-Sarah

i keeeed!
11:11pmJim

i guess that goes so far beyond my "can you do it when you've believed you can't" idea.... but perhaps you've proved a point...

haha

it's like

sitting on a toilet seat at a gas station

I suppose i "could"

but dang... i don't wanna
11:11pmHeather-Sarah

no like my mom and conervative christian.... someone can not be born gay, thats impossible! but ithink ive won my mom over a little
11:12pmJim

i can say this:

i was born with the desire to have sex with LOTS of women... it's what I DO with that desire that matters

I flat out DON'T do it

even though there is a part of me that wants to

I think anyone is the same

we want to do things that are not good for us

and standing on the outside of that comment i can say

of course that is ridiculous

I'd ruin SO many amazing things

the question is
11:13pmHeather-Sarah

well being attracted to or in love with someone becaue u are WIRED to is not necisarily something thats not "good' for you
11:13pmJim

if you are attacted to the same sex

is that something that you should chase?

or say
11:14pmHeather-Sarah

but ur born that way

is it a sin to be born with down syndrome?

no

they acnt control that
11:14pmJim

i can pretty much attest to the fact that I am born to want to chase women

it's wired into me

just like every guy you've ever met

at some point

i had to say

you know Jim, this just isn't good

not because i want to be super pious

or anything like that

more because i don't want what follows that life

now

if a dude is into other guys

and realizes it'll lead to a lifetime with this other guy

and we're going to get married

and be together forever

I can't fault that
11:16pmHeather-Sarah

right

thats what i mean

not promisciouss gay love

cause thatd be sooo gay

;);)
11:17pmJim

lol

you're gay
11:17pmHeather-Sarah

i am sooo happy! its true
11:17pmJim

and i LOVE using the word gay to mean "retarded" which means stupide

i love to offend everyone
11:17pmHeather-Sarah

oh, i really use nieither

i say dumb

or ridciulous
11:18pmJim

i'm an equal opportunity offender

if i can somehow work misogyny into it

i do

you're a WOMAN

OHHHHHHHHHH

you can't pee standing up
11:19pmHeather-Sarah

thank goodness

thats gross
11:19pmJim

oh wait

wait

actutally

that is a pretty good one
11:20pmHeather-Sarah

but i also dont have to pee in public restrooms being able to be face to face with the person next to me
11:20pmJim

true true

but if you were told, ok, go pee in your bathroom right now, life the lid and pee facing your wall

is that succeed-able

or fail
11:21pmHeather-Sarah

i feel no need to find out
11:21pmJim

once again

i think MY point is proven

you have the ease of saying "i'd rather not know"

and it alleviates you of even trying

wow

and this one

even though it would take a minute or so to clean up if you were wrong

is SOOOO easy to prove or disprove
11:23pmJim

you already know if you'd fali

fail
11:28pmJim

wow

that really did shut you up
11:30pmHeather-Sarah

no, when i switch pages it sometiems ereases whole convos so i cant

respond

cause tehre s not ing thereh

but im off to hopefully find something i need for sunday
11:31pmJim

oh wow

and here i thought you were so super offended that i told you to pee
11:31pmHeather-Sarah

ha
11:31pmJim

11:31pmHeather-Sarah

11:31pmJim
